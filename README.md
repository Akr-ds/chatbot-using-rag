## Overview
### The RAG Bot (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Bot) is a sophisticated AI chatbot designed to provide enhanced and accurate responses by leveraging a combination of retrieval-based and generation-based techniques. This project utilizes state-of-the-art models to retrieve relevant information from a pre-defined dataset and generate coherent, contextually appropriate responses.

## Features
### The RAG Bot combines the strengths of information retrieval with natural language generation to deliver precise and informative responses. It utilizes advanced models like SBERT for embedding generation and GPT-like models for text generation. By employing Pinecone, it ensures efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings. The bot supports complex queries and provides detailed responses by searching and summarizing relevant documents. An interactive notebook interface is provided through Jupyter, allowing for easy interaction, testing, and customization of the RAG bot.
